  + tasks.ipynb
  + project.ipynb <br>
All commentary, task/project descriptions and references are included in the Notebooks.


Other files in the repository include: 
  + requirements.txt
  + /data

## Getting Started

The notebooks can be run in two ways:

  1. On your local machine using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
  2. Instantly online using [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).


### Option 1: Run Locally (VS Code + Anaconda)

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine: <br>
  ```git clone https://github.com/Eilis9/applied_statistics.git```
  ```cd applied_statistics```
  2. Set up a virtual environment using Anaconda: <br>
  ```conda create -n applied_stats python=3.12``` <br>
  ```conda activate applied_stats``` <br>
  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>
  3. Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) <br>
    - Open the repository folder in VS Code
    - Install the Python extension if prompted
    - Select the applied_stats environment as the Python interpreter

  4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks: <br>
    - Open the notebook file (tasks.ipynb or project.ipynb) in VS Code
    - Use the integrated Jupyter Notebook interface to run the cells

### Option 2: Run using Github Codespaces

  1. Click on the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces". <br>
  2. The repository will open in a Codespace in your browser.<br>
  3. Open the Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the file name in the file list.<br>
